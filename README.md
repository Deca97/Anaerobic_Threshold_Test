# Conconi Test Analysis

## Overview

This project performs an analysis of heart rate and speed data from a Conconi test stored in Garmin FIT files. Using Python, it calculates an individual's anaerobic thresholdâ€”a key performance metric for endurance athletes.

## Features

Extract heart rate and speed data from Garmin FIT files.

Smooth data using a moving average technique.

Calculate anaerobic threshold using the Conconi method with slope detection improvements.

Convert speed to pace (min/km).

Visualize heart rate vs. speed with anaerobic threshold marked on the graph.
